🍓 **About Me**

My name is `$Vanilla$` (or `Vanilla_chan`), and I'm an **AFOIer & ACMer & MCMer** (used to be an OIer too! 😎)

🌱 Currently studying at a non-top-tier university's big data program (with a touch of sadness 😢)
A noob, was one before, still am now, and might always be... but I'll keep trying my best! 💪

✨ Things I like:
- Playing GalGames 🎮 (though I often get stuck 😭)
- Tinkering with things (but I'm not good at anything—just mess around with small projects)
- Doing what I want to do (like coding, learning algorithms, drawing...)
- Learning algorithms! (Goal: become an algorithm engineer who solves tough problems with clever code!)

⚡ What I hope for:
To use code and math to create miracles, making the world just a little more interesting 😊

(P.S. If you see me daydreaming or frantically typing—don't worry! Probably thinking about algorithms again 😅)
